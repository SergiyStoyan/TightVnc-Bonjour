- (a) unencrypted RFB, (b) encrypted RFB or (c)* encrypted UDP
stream*

- the server can once 
connected via VNC, look to a specific port with UDP on 10.10.1.1 (for
example).

Once the VNCclient disconnects then all the ports disconnect as well.



1) As per the diagram I would like the RFB option to remain as is but add encrypted VNC session using the openSSH libraries. 
2) advertise that service on bonjour as suggested

3) Would like the option of enabling ffmpeg streaming independently of RFB using ffmpeg (or libav) libraries. 
This is an option that is off by default but can be enabled in the options. This completely bypasses RFB functions.
This stream becomes available ONLY if the CisteraVNC accepts a valid incoming request. 

Desktop: ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 10 -i desktop -f mpegts udp://10.10.1.1:5920
Backend: udp://10.10.1.1:5920


>ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 10 -i desktop -f mpegts udp://128.0.0.1:5920
>ffplay udp://128.0.0.1:5920




4) Option to Encrypt this session back the BACKEND 
5) Advertise this capability onto Boujour with port to use but ONLY if authenticated user. 



QUESTIONS:

!!!prevent zombie process!!!

- the problem is that session starts, passes authentication and closes on RFB connection. So, to monitor all those events for ffmpeg streaming, we have to keep RFB connection together with ffmpeg stream. Does it meet your needs or transferring RFB video must be suppressed?




once the session has disconnected, then the streaming should stop. 

parameters of streaming are: framerate, port, screen coordinates, start delay, suppress RFB video. Those are pre-configured on VNC server.


- should be Screen Streamer be configured in separated tab? Or, just inlcude it in Server tab?
