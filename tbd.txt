- (a) unencrypted RFB, (b) encrypted RFB or (c)* encrypted UDP
stream*

- the server can once 
connected via VNC, look to a specific port with UDP on 10.10.1.1 (for
example).

Once the VNCclient disconnects then all the ports disconnect as well.



1) As per the diagram I would like the RFB option to remain as is but add encrypted VNC session using the openSSH libraries. 
2) advertise that service on bonjour as suggested

3) Would like the option of enabling ffmpeg streaming independently of RFB using ffmpeg (or libav) libraries. 
This is an option that is off by default but can be enabled in the options. This completely bypasses RFB functions.
This stream becomes available ONLY if the CisteraVNC accepts a valid incoming request. 

Desktop: ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 10 -i desktop -f mpegts udp://10.10.1.1:5920
Backend: udp://10.10.1.1:5920


>ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 10 -i desktop -f mpegts udp://128.0.0.1:5920
>ffplay udp://128.0.0.1:5920




4) Option to Encrypt this session back the BACKEND 
5) Advertise this capability onto Boujour with port to use but ONLY if authenticated user. 



QUESTIONS:

- >This stream becomes available ONLY if the CisteraVNC accepts a valid incoming request. 

What kind of request must be? will the client send a certain command to VNC server with the receiving ip:port to demand screen streaming? To which ip:port to such a request is to be sent? Should the server advertize the screen streaming option by Bonjour?
